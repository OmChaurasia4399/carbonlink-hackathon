High-Level Concept
CarbonLink is a dual-purpose platform combining education + engagement for carbon credit generation with data-driven carbon credit trading insights.

It bridges the carbon harvesters (individuals, farmers, small organizations) and market participants (companies, investors, and analysts). The platform is divided into two main components:

PART 1 — Knowledge, Integration, and Support Layer
(Focus: awareness, onboarding, and generation of carbon credits)

Objective Educate, guide, and integrate users into the carbon ecosystem so that they can adopt and document carbon-positive practices that generate verified credits.

Core Modules

Knowledge Hub

Repository of structured educational material on sustainable practices: reforestation, regenerative agriculture, renewable energy adoption, waste reduction, etc.

Content format: short articles, explainers, infographics, and video modules.

Multi-language support for regional accessibility.

Includes a “Learn → Apply → Earn” flow guiding users from theory to action.

Action Integration System

Users register eco-projects or activities (tree planting, sustainable farming, biogas use, etc.).

Each action type has:

Step-by-step guide

Documentation checklist (photo, GPS, timestamp)

Expected CO 
2
​
  reduction range

Support & Verification Interface

Users can upload proof for activities (image + coordinates).

Proofs go into a verification queue handled manually or semi-automatically.

Admins review submissions and approve verified actions.

Upon approval, users receive CarbonLink Credits (CLC) representing their CO 
2
​
  offsets.

Profile & Impact Dashboard

Displays user’s verified eco-actions, total CO 
2
​
  offset, badges, and progress over time.

Simple gamified metrics to maintain engagement (trees planted, carbon reduced, rank among peers).

PART 2 — Market Intelligence and Trading Insight Layer
(Focus: carbon credit price intelligence, company sustainability data, and market analytics)

Objective Provide real-time insights and transparency into carbon credit pricing, company green performance, and market dynamics to support data-driven trading and valuation.

Core Modules

Market Overview Dashboard

Aggregates live or simulated data from carbon markets (starting with voluntary markets).

Displays:

Current carbon credit prices by region and standard

Trading volume trends

Historical price graphs

Company Green Index

Lists companies operating in voluntary markets and their environmental performance metrics.

Each company profile includes:

Emission trends

Sustainability investments

ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) score

Recent “green” or “anti-green” news sentiment (auto-scraped via APIs)

Sentiment-Based Pricing Indicator

Simple analytics layer showing predicted carbon credit price sensitivity based on company actions:

If a company announces strong green initiatives → expected demand for credits decreases → price drops.

If a company delays decarbonization or reports poor ESG results → demand increases → price rises.

Visualized through:

Real-time graphs

Sentiment-to-price correlation chart

Trading Information Panel

Lists verified carbon credit projects (mock data for MVP).

Shows price trends, buyers, and sellers.

For MVP, only display data; future versions can include wallet integration for actual transactions.

Data Flow Summary
User Layer: user registers → adds eco-action → uploads proof.

Admin Layer: verifies proof → credits issued → stored in wallet.

Analytics Layer: market data pulled and processed → graphs, company indices, and sentiment updates displayed.

User Insight Layer: user views both their carbon contributions and global market movements on one unified dashboard.

Long-Term Vision
Full tokenization of credits (blockchain-backed CLC tokens).

Partnerships with local governments, NGOs, and carbon buyers.

Integration with voluntary carbon registries for official credit recognition.

Predictive AI layer forecasting carbon credit prices based on global sustainability sentiment and economic indicators.
